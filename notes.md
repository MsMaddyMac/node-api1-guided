- install Express -> run 'yarn add express'
- create an index.js file to the root folder
- to use modules from Express we need to use require(), it is the same as using import/export
- add server code inside 'index.js'
- run the API using 'yarn run server'
- test making a GET request to 'localhost:4000'

[ client ] send a 'request' to the [ server ] will receive it and send a 'response' back to the [ client ]. Order matters, you always send a req first and a res after.
